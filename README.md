### Problem Statement :


### Model :

Keras Core and Keras Legacy implementation of the below paper
[CASS: Cross Architectural Self-Supervision for Medical Image Analysis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.07270.pdf)

### Dataset : 

AffectNet is a database of facial expressions and contains more than  1M facial images collected from the Internet by querying three major search engines using 1250 emotion-related keywords in six different languages.
