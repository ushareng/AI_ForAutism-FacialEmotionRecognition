### Problem Statement :

Inferring emotions from facial expressions is very critical for social communication and deficits in facial emotion recognition are a very important marker in the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder. This project uses AI to help autistic individuals recognize emotions in facial expressions.


### Model :

Keras Core and Keras implementation of the below paper
[Distract Your Attention: Multi-head Cross Attention Network for Facial Expression Recognition](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.07270.pdf)

### Dataset : 

AffectNet is a database of facial expressions and contains more than  1M facial images collected from the Internet by querying three major search engines using 1250 emotion-related keywords in six different languages. The labeled emotions in the dataset are neutral, happy, angry, sad, fear, surprise, disgust, and contempt.
